# synvirus-pycones24
This repository includes the slides of the public presentation 'Cómo destruir el mundo usando Python y un virus sintético' of PyConES 2024 and both the code and files used for the practical case (slide 19 onwards).

## Installation
You simply have to download the .py and fasta files (or get your own fasta files from a database as [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)).

## Usage
First you'll have to select the file of the genome of your virus of interest. Then select the file of the gene you want to add to the virus and introduce the mutation position (as a positive integer) where you want to enter this gene. When finished, you'll have three .txt files saved in the same folder of the .py file with the RNA guide, the DNA mold and the mutated virus.
